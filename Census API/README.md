## Census API Overview
Welcome! In my graduate course in Research Design for Political Analysis we worked out of the Walker textbook which I will link below.

Here you can find all the assignments I did for class, which was mainly working through the chapters and problemsets within.

This includes lots of mapping, spatial data analysis, model creation, and data wrangling with tidyverse.
