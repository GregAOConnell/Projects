## Trump Logit Overview
In this project I used a UMD adminstered survey and the resulting data to perform a logistic regression that predicts the likelihood of a vote for Trump.

The two variables I tested were Party ID and whether or not respondents had trust in U.S. institutions. The findings and final write up will be attached in a pdf.

Clifnotes are that too many respondents said they did not trust institutions so the results were not statistically significant, but there was a signifcant relationship between Party ID and a Trump vote.
